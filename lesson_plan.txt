Still to do: develop code assessments, develop slides, develop demo notebooks, double check everything,
send syllabus to CDS office.
For code quizzes: create a graph, then show a code snippet with words removed. Student has to fill
in missing words (multiple fill in the blanks)
Try to make sure that graphs created to show and for quizzes explicitly conform to guiding principles.

format, color, text, labels, scaling, data density, chart junk, data integrity, attribution
How to get started:
- what is your purpose for creating the graph? to answer some question.
- what is the question? who what where when how why
- what types of graphs go with each question?
- what types of data are there? categorical, univariate, geospatial, multivariate, time series, text, social network
- what types of graphs go with each type of data?

- How do these things compare? (similarity / difference: size, shape, proportion, frequency, speed, performance, value)
- How are these things linked? (pos / neg, strong / weak: relationships, actions, statistical)
- How is this thing distributed? (statistical distributions)
- Where are these things? (location, comparison across locations)
- How did this thing change over time? (pos / neg: size, shape, frequency, speed, performance, value)
