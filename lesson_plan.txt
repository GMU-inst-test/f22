Still to do: develop code assessments, develop slides, develop demo notebooks, double check everything,
send syllabus to CDS office.
For code quizzes: create a graph, then show a code snippet with words removed. Student has to fill
in missing words (multiple fill in the blanks)
Try to make sure that graphs created to show and for quizzes explicitly conform to guiding principles.

READING DAY	5 Dec

format, color, text, labels, scaling, data density, chart junk, data integrity, attribution
How to get started:
- what is your purpose for creating the graphic? to answer some question.
- what is the question? who what where when how why
- what types of graphs go with each question?
- what types of data are there? categorical, univariate, geospatial, multivariate, time series, text, social network
- what types of graphs go with each type of data?
- How do these things compare? (similarity / difference: size, shape, proportion, frequency, speed, performance, value)
- How are these things linked? (pos / neg, strong / weak: relationships, actions, statistical)
- How is this thing distributed? (statistical distributions)
- Where are these things? (location, comparison across locations)
- How did this thing change over time? (pos / neg: size, shape, frequency, speed, performance, value)

Mixture of Gestalt's principles, and others in the readings:
Figure ground: foreground, background, to draw attention to something
Similarity: things that you want to be perceived as being together look similar
Proximity / common region: things that you want people to associate with each other should be close
Continuity: how does the eye follow lines on your graph
Closure: the eye naturally perceives outlines or connections where there are none
Focal point (highlight the message): the thing of importance should stand out (length, width, orientation, size, shape, color, position)
Text should be readable
Labels should be clear and readable, and close to data so reader doesn't need to switch back and forth 
Scaling should support the message, not hinder it 
Reduce chart junk: start with nothing and add what is needed
Attribute your data
Use title as key takeaway
Use explainers to help readers understand and follow the graph
Use color only where it helps, start with gray and add what is needed
Keep shapes orderly (e.g. aligned)
Tell a story with the data
Minimize / eliminate lie factor
Have a style guide (I need to make one for myself), maybe encode in Python as a function

Style guide:
Title:
Axes:
Labels:
Legend:
Colors:
Plot types: (have code library)
Seaborn: set theme(style, palette, ticks, axes.spines.(right, left, top, bottom), font, font scale, color codes, rc (custom param dictionary))
